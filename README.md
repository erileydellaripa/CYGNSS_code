# CYGNSS_code

- processing_code directory contains the code I used to process the Level 2 CYGNSS wind speed and fluxes into hourly, 1deg x 1deg bins

- CYGNSS_tools.py contains several functions that were used to analyze and plot the binned CYGNSS data, as well as the ERA5 data

- These codes were used to complete the analysis and figures for Riley Dellaripa et al. (submitted to JGR Atmos) entitled "The Diurnal Cycle of East Pacific Convection, Moisture, and CYGNSS Wind Speed and Fluxes" by Emily Riley Dellaripa, Eric Maloney, and Charlotte DeMott at Colorado State Univerisity and spondered by the NASA CYGNSS mission.
